        Most recently from the BBC, the article “How can England reclaim its moors?” is an 
        article that shows the cultural difference between the United Kingdom and the United States. 
        Written by Richard Collett, the article tells of the battle that the people had to fight to maintain 
        the right to camp and hike and free roam over Dartmoor National Park.

        For decades, Dartmoor National Park has been one of the few places in England that 
        protects the rights of people to freely roam the park. Similarly in the U.S., people must get 
        permission otherwise to be on another person&#39;s property. In our country, this law would not have 
        any conflict regarding our national parks. However, unlike in the United States, people can buy 
        land in the national park and therefore making it their private property and all the rights to it.

        These conflicting laws have never been an issue until Alexander Darwall stopped 
        allowing backpackers on his property. This led to a ruling by the High Court of England last 
        January that gave Dartmoor landowners the right to stop public access to their lands. 
        Citizens and visitors alike were furious about the ruling. National associations like the 
        Open Spaces Society, Dartmoor Preservation Association, and Dartmoor National Park Authority
        worked hard to change the ruling. A protest on Darwall&#39;s property also occurred and was one of 
        the largest protests in England. The people of England came together to protect their right to 
        Dartmoor Park, a right that has gained importance after the COVID pandemic. In the end, the 
        people of England were able to successfully get an appeal to the original ruling leading to free 
        roaming on Dartmoor once again.
