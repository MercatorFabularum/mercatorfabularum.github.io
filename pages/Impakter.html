        In addition to writing articles, Impakter keeps a index that tracks the sustainability of the largest companies in the world in multiple sectors. 
        Companies are given a letter rating that corresponds to the level of sustainability that the company 
        hold. Letters A and B are considered sustainable companies, C and D are considered companies that are working on it, and F is for companies that 
        are not trying to increase their sustainability at all. These ratings are determined using the index from the UN Sustainability Development Goals.
